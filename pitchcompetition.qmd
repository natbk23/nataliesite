  As a Duolingo user with a streak of over 150 days, I am passionate about the app. However, I had a few ideas for how Duolingo could personalize the experience; namely through use of AI at the setup stage.

## The Pain Point

Duolingo's mission is to create the most effective language education tool in the world. But from personal experience in addition to conducting user interviews, this approach is neglecting the needs of many users. What about language learners who aren’t as ambitious? Or have a time crunch?

Users should be able to specialize their learning.

They should have the ability to select 

-   topics of interest

-   timeframe 

-   functional end goals
