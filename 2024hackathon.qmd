title: "2024 Hackathon Figma Wireframe"
description: |
  The theme of the 2024 Claremont College Hackathon was "Tech for Good". My team created a full web prototype of our app Call Your Mom. Our product supports alcohol safety among college students by calculating a drink maximum estimate, presenting an accessible drink counter, integrating a rideshare API, and establishing a streamlined emergency services connection.
