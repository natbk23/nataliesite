title: "Alcohol Safety Figma Wireframe"
description: |
  The theme of the 2024 Claremont College Hackathon was "Tech for Good". My team created a full web prototype of our app Call Your Mom. Our product supports alcohol safety among college students by calculating a drink maximum estimate, presenting an accessible drink counter, integrating a rideshare API, and establishing a streamlined emergency services connection.

## My Role

I was the principal UX Designer, but also acted as product manager as I oversaw the entire development from ideation to presentation. We made sure to conduct user testing to maintain a human-centered approach throughout our iterations.
