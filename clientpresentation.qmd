## Project Summary

![Find a single study from the WAI database where subjects of different sex, race, ethnicity, or age groups were enrolled.](images/clipboard-2844787304.png)

## Research Interest

I was particularly interested about differences in mean absorbance between **race.** However, exploring the Subjects dataframe taught me that very few studies were examining racial demographics.

## Findings

Rosowski et al. (2012) is a study that took a unique approach to race.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(RMariaDB)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(mdsr)
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)


con_wai <- dbConnect(
  MariaDB(), host = "scidb.smith.edu",
  user = "waiuser", password = "smith_waiDB", 
  dbname = "wai"
)
Measurements <- tbl(con_wai, "Measurements")
PI_Info <- tbl(con_wai, "PI_Info")
Subjects <- tbl(con_wai, "Subjects")

# collect(Measurements)
```

```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai
#| output.var: "q2_graph"

SELECT Frequency, Race,
    AVG(Absorbance) AS ave_absorbance
FROM Subjects AS s
INNER JOIN Measurements AS m ON m.SubjectNumber = s.SubjectNumber
WHERE m.Identifier = "Rosowski_2012" AND s.Identifier = "Rosowski_2012" 
AND Frequency > 200 AND Frequency < 8000
GROUP BY Race, Frequency;
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
q2_graph |>
  ggplot(aes (x = Frequency, y = ave_absorbance,
              color = Race,
              group = Race)) +
  geom_line() +
   labs(
    x = "Frequency (Hz)",
    y = "Mean Absorbance",
    title = "Mean Absorbance from Rosowski et al across Race",
    color = "Race"
  ) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
q2_graph |>
  ggplot(aes (x = Frequency, y = ave_absorbance,
              color = Race,
              group = Race)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Race) + 
   labs(
    x = "Frequency (Hz)",
    y = "Mean Absorbance",
    title = "Mean Absorbance from Rosowski et al across Race",
    color = "Race"
  ) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

## Implications

Rosowski et al.'s findings suggest that there were differences in average absorbance across "races". However, the races are incredibly limited, and isolate *Chinese* from *Asian*.

-   What does this mean for conclusions regarding race?

-   How do we even classify race?

> *Research indicates that the prevalence of hearing loss does differ across races, with studies consistently showing that non-Hispanic Black individuals generally have lower rates of hearing loss compared to non-Hispanic White individuals; meaning deafness may appear less frequently in the Black population compared to the White population.*

However, the data to support these claims is insufficient. Are black individuals truly less likely to experience hearing loss, or it just underreported?

## Takeaways

This project reinforced the message that **data isn't everything.**

## Thank You!
