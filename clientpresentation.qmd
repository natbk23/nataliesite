## Project Summary

![Find a single study from the WAI database where subjects of different sex, race, ethnicity, or age groups were enrolled.](images/clipboard-2844787304.png)

## Research Interest

I was particularly interested about differences in mean absorbance between **race.** However, exploring the Subjects dataframe taught me that very few studies were examining racial demographics.

## Findings

Rosowski et al. (2012) is a study that took a unique approach to race.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(RMariaDB)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(mdsr)
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)


con_wai <- dbConnect(
  MariaDB(), host = "scidb.smith.edu",
  user = "waiuser", password = "smith_waiDB", 
  dbname = "wai"
)
Measurements <- tbl(con_wai, "Measurements")
PI_Info <- tbl(con_wai, "PI_Info")
Subjects <- tbl(con_wai, "Subjects")

# collect(Measurements)
```

```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai
#| output.var: "q2_graph"

SELECT Frequency, Race,
    AVG(Absorbance) AS ave_absorbance
FROM Subjects AS s
RIGHT JOIN Measurements AS m ON m.Identifier = s.Identifier 
WHERE m.Identifier = "Rosowski_2012" AND Frequency > 200 AND Frequency < 8000
GROUP BY Race, Frequency
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(q2_graph)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
q2_graph |>
  ggplot(aes (x = Frequency, y = ave_absorbance,
              color = Race,
              group = Race)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
q2_graph |>
  ggplot(aes (x = Frequency, y = ave_absorbance,
              color = Race,
              group = Race)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Race) + 
  scale_x_log10()
```

## Implications 

Rosowski et al.'s findings suggest that there was absolutely no difference in average absorbance across "races". In fact, there was little variation between *any* of the participants.

However, the data to support these claims is insufficient. Are black individuals truly less likely to experience hearing loss, or it just underreported?
